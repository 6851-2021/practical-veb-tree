# Practical vEB Tree

The goal of this project is to implement a version (variant) of van Emde Boas tree that can outperform standard (comparison based) containers.

Currently we're testing our implementation against `std::set` and `__gnu_pbds::tree`. We may add hand-written data structures for comparisons at a later stage. We focus particularly on three operations that van Emde Boas trees natively support: `insert`, `delete`, `successor`.

#### Scenario 1

Keys are integers in $U=[0,2^{30})$.

Implementations are tested on $2^{25}$ random operations. 30% insert, 15% delete, 55% successor.

##### Implementation Detail (full_veb.hpp)

+ Based on the $O(|U|)$ space simplified version discussed in-class
+ Use template meta programming to help optimize constants
+ When $|U|$ is small enough to fit into a word ($|U|\le 32$), we encode the existence of elements simply into a word (similar to `std::bitset`), lowering the space to $\sim |U|/32$ and vastly improve constant factor

##### Testing Detail & Environment (test_1.cpp)

Random operations are first generated as described. Implementations are tested on the same set of operations and results are checked.

Testing environment: Windows, Laptop with CPU Intel i7-7700HQ @ 2.80GHz, MinGW x64 (`-Ofast`)

##### Result Summary

| Key space           | \# of Operations  | Final size | set    | pb_ds          | *vEB*         |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ------ | -------------- | ------------- |
| $2^{30}=1073741824$ | $2^{25}=33554432$ | 9991769â€‹    | 48.36s | 39.91s (1.21x) | 7.60s (6.36x) |

Even including the 1.23s took to build the giant vEB tree, this version of vEB tree still got a 6.36x speedup against `std::set`.

#### Scenario 2

Keys are integers in $U=[0,2^{60})$ (so we cannot really afford to build the whole vEB tree).

Implementations are tested on $2^{25}$ random operations. 30% insert, 15% delete, 55% successor.

The current plan is to use cuckoo hashing. Not implemented yet. https://ideone.com/ijZ3Z5
